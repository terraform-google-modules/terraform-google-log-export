# Log Export: Storage destination submodule

This submodule allows you to configure a Google Cloud Storage bucket destination that
can be used by the log export created in the root module.

## Usage

The [examples](../../examples) directory contains directories for each destination, and within each destination directory are directories for each parent resource level. Consider the following
example that will configure a storage bucket destination and a log export at the project level:

```hcl
module "log_export" {
  source                 = "terraform-google-modules/log-export/google"
  destination_uri        = "${module.destination.destination_uri}"
  filter                 = "severity >= ERROR"
  log_sink_name          = "storage_example_logsink"
  parent_resource_id     = "sample-project"
  parent_resource_type   = "project"
  unique_writer_identity = true
}

module "destination" {
  source                   = "terraform-google-modules/log-export/google//modules/storage"
  project_id               = "sample-project"
  storage_bucket_name      = "sample_storage_bucket"
  log_sink_writer_identity = "${module.log_export.writer_identity}"
}
```

At first glance that example seems like a circular dependency as each module declaration is
using an output from the other, however Terraform is able to collect and order all the resources
so that all dependencies are met.
