# Log Export: Log Bucket destination at Project level

These examples configures a project-level log sink that feeds a logging log bucket destination with log bucket and log sink in the same project or in separated projects. This example also configures [Log Analytics](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/log-analytics) in the log bucket with a linked BigQuery dataset.
