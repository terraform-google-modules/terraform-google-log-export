# Example: BigQuery Log Alerting solution

This example deploys the BigQuery Log Alerting submodule in an existing project.

## Prerequisites

To run this example, you'll need:

- An existing "logging" project
- A [Log export](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-log-export) with a [BigQuery destination](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-log-export/tree/master/modules/bigquery) in the logging project. The export filter should include at least:
  - "logName: /logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Factivity"
  - "logName: /logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Fdata_access"
  - "logName: /logs/compute.googleapis.com%2Fvpc_flows"
- A Terraform Service Account with the [IAM Roles](../../../modules/bq-log-alerting/README.md) listed in the module documentation.
- To enable the [APIs](../../../modules/bq-log-alerting/README.md) listed in the module documentation in the logging project.
- To enable [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine) in the logging project.
To enable it manually use:

```shell
gcloud app create \
--region=<REGION> \
--project=<LOGGING_PROJECT> \
--impersonate-service-account=<TERRAFORM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL>
```

**Note 1:** The selected Google App Engine region cannot be changed after creation.

**Note 2:** On deployment a Security Command Center Source called "BQ Log Alerts" will be created. If this source already exist due to the solution been deployed at least once before,  obtain the existing Source name to be used in the terraform variable **source_name**. Run:

```shell
gcloud scc sources describe <ORG_ID> \
--source-display-name="BQ Log Alerts" \
--format="value(name)" \
--impersonate-service-account=<TERRAFORM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL>
```

The [terraform-example-foundation](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-example-foundation) can be used as a reference for the creation of the project, service account and log export.

## Instructions

1. Run `terraform init`
1. Run `terraform plan` provide the requested variables values and review the output.
1. Run `terraform apply`
